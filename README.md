# MEDonor

Our project aims to counter two problems. <br>
- one faced by NGO(s) workers searching for particular medicines <br>
- for donors to look for NGOs eager to use the unused medicienes to distribute among needy people. <br>
<br>
It will cut back the need to go to different hospitals/medicine providers for medicines. The shop-vendors/individual can directly learn from the website and contact that person/shop. It makes the process effortless,  attracting more people to volunteer for the organization. <br>
